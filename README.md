# Trax

Naive tracking of Wisconsin's vaccination progress.

I am not an expert, there's probably many reasons why you the statistics I report here are incorrect.

```
$ python trax.py
28538 average doses per day over past 7 days (-456 compared to 2 weeks ago)
52.4 weeks (2022-02-21) for EVERY PERSON to get 2 doses
40.7 weeks (2021-12-02) for all eligible people (over 16 years old) to get 2 doses
```
